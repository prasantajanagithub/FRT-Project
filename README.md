# Personalized Fitness Assistant

## Project Description
This project aims to address the problem of inconsistent exercise routines by developing a personalized fitness assistant powered by AI and data analytics. Through tailored workout plans, real-time feedback, and motivational support, our platform will empower users to stay on track with their fitness goals and lead healthier lifestyles.

## Key Features
- **Personalized Workout Plans:** Generating customized workout routines based on users' fitness levels, goals, and preferences.
- **Real-time Feedback:** Providing instant feedback on exercise form and performance to help users optimize their workouts.
- **Progress Tracking:** Monitoring users' progress over time and adjusting workout plans accordingly to ensure continuous improvement.
- **Nutritional Guidance:** Offering dietary recommendations and meal planning assistance to complement users' fitness routines.
- **Motivational Support:** Sending encouraging messages, reminders, and achievements to keep users motivated and engaged.

## Core Azure Services
- **Azure Machine Learning:** Leveraging machine learning algorithms to analyze user data and generate personalized fitness recommendations.
- **Azure AI Bot Service:** Building conversational AI interfaces to interact with users and provide real-time support and guidance.
- **Azure AI Service:**
  - **Azure AI Personalizer:** Utilizing reinforcement learning techniques to adapt fitness recommendations based on users' preferences and behavior.

## Repository Structure
- **/src:** Contains the source code for the personalized fitness assistant.
